This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a RecursionError caused by improper handling of the base case in a recursive function. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when the factorial function is called with a negative number, leading to infinite recursion and exceeding the maximum recursion depth allowed by Python.
